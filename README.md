# ttcp (Test TCP) - Benchmarking Tool and Simple Network Traffic Generator

This is a ruby version of the original C ttcp program.

This tool aims to be a drop in replacement for the original C version, with interoperable networking and command line options. ie: you can have the C and ruby versions talk to each other.

## Installation

Run `$ gem install ttcp`.

## Usage

Similar to the original TTCP program, run a receiver on one machine and a transmitter on another, in that order:
```machine1$ ttcp -r [-p <port>]
```

And:
```machine2$ ttcp -t <machine1_ip_address> [-p port]
```

For more command line options run:
```machine1$ ttcp --help
```
